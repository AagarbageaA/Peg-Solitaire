## Introduction

This is the final project for a course in assembly language, completed collaboratively by two individuals. The project focuses on implementing the classic game of Peg Solitaire.

## Game Overview

Peg Solitaire is a puzzle game played on a board with 32 pegs. The objective of the game is to eliminate as many pegs as possible by jumping one peg over another, removing the peg that was jumped. The game ends when there is only one peg left on the board or when no legal moves are possible.

3. Attempt to eliminate as many pegs as possible, following the rules mentioned above.
4. The game ends when there is only one peg left or when no legal moves are available.

## Installation
